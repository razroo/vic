Vic - A programming language with emphasis on vector compute performance. Don't know if will be able to do it, but a man can dream

1. Native Support for Vector Operations: The language should have built-in support for vector operations, allowing programmers to express computations using vectors easily. This includes vector arithmetic, vectorized functions, and operations that can take advantage of the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities of the vector processor.

2. Explicit Vectorization: To ensure optimal vectorization, the language should encourage or enforce explicit vectorization in the code. This can be achieved through special syntax or annotations that indicate which parts of the code can be vectorized, allowing the compiler to generate efficient vector instructions.

3. Memory Layout Control: Vector processors often require data to be laid out in a specific way to take full advantage of their capabilities. The language should provide mechanisms to control memory layout and alignment to facilitate efficient data access and vectorization.

4. Parallelism and Concurrency: Since vector processors excel at parallel computations, the language should support parallelism and concurrency constructs explicitly. This could include vectorized loops, parallel execution blocks, and mechanisms for data parallelism.

5. Performance-Oriented Abstractions: The language should provide high-level abstractions that are conducive to vectorization and performance optimization. This means allowing the programmer to express algorithms in a way that naturally maps to vector operations.

6. Compiler Optimization Support: A strong focus on compiler optimizations is essential for a vector programming language. The compiler should be able to recognize vectorization opportunities and generate efficient vector code.

7. Integration with Existing Languages: Considering the vast amount of code already written in other programming languages, providing interoperability or easy integration with popular languages can be beneficial. This may include providing bindings or interfaces to call vectorized functions from other languages.

8. Error Prevention and Vectorization Safety: The language should have safety mechanisms to prevent vectorization errors, such as ensuring vector lengths match or avoiding data dependencies that can inhibit vectorization.

9. Debugging and Profiling Support: Debugging and profiling tools specific to the vector architecture should be available to aid in optimizing vector code and identifying performance bottlenecks.

10. Portability and Compatibility: While tailored for vector computers, the language should aim to be as portable as possible across different vector architectures, ensuring code written in the language can be efficiently executed on various vector processors.

11. Documentation and Community Support: To foster adoption, the language should have comprehensive documentation and a supportive community for developers to exchange knowledge and best practices.
